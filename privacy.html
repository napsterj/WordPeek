  <h1>WordPeek Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Effective Date: 10th January 2026</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    WordPeek is a Chrome extension that allows users to look up the meaning of a selected word on any webpage using a right-click context menu.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    WordPeek does not collect personal or sensitive information. The only data processed is the word selected by the user and its dictionary definitions, which are temporarily stored locally to improve performance.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Usage</h2>
  <p>
    The selected word and dictionary definitions are used solely to display meanings to the user and to cache recent lookups. No data is used for advertising, analytics, tracking, or profiling.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>
    WordPeek uses Chrome's <code>chrome.storage.sync</code> to temporarily store selected words and their definitions. This data is non-personal and is synced only across the user’s devices via Chrome.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    WordPeek does not sell, share, or transfer user data to third parties. Selected words are sent only to the dictionary API to fetch definitions.
  </p>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>contextMenus:</strong> Required to add a right-click menu option for looking up words.</li>
    <li><strong>host permissions:</strong> Required to fetch word definitions from a dictionary API.</li>
    <li><strong>storage:</strong> Required to temporarily store selected words and their definitions for caching purposes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>User Control</h2>
  <p>
    WordPeek only acts when the user selects a word and clicks the context menu. No background tracking occurs.
  </p>
